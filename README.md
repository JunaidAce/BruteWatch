# 🔐 BruteWatch
### Web Authentication Brute‑Force Detection System

BruteWatch is a **Python & Flask-based defensive security system** designed to detect and block brute-force attacks against web authentication endpoints.

---
## 📌 Project Overview

Brute-force attacks target login mechanisms by attempting multiple password combinations.  
BruteWatch monitors failed login attempts in real time and automatically blocks malicious IP addresses when suspicious behavior is detected.

This project demonstrates **blue‑team security concepts**, intrusion detection logic, and secure authentication monitoring.
